## How many points can I score per fixture/match?

If you guessed:

- The right amount of goals per team: 2 points. So 2 x 2 points.
- The correct outcome of the game (winner or draw): 5 points
- The complete outcome, i.e. amount of goals and outcome: 1 point.

_This means that if you guessed everything right, you can earn 10 points per match._
